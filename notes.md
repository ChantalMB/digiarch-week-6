# Week 6: Notes

- Topic Modelling
  - A Topic Model of 75 Years of Archaeological Scholarship
    - Stream graphs are kind of confusing to read
      - I always expect the verticality of the graph to mean something
    - Could the decline of topic 46 (sites/area/survey) signify a shift/increase in the discussion of digital pursuits?
    - What happened in ~1976 with topic 36 (ruler/stela/tikal/date)?
      - Journal articles indicate a number of archaeological discoveries
      - Googling tells me that from 1950s to 1970s major archaeological excavations were being done for "Tikal Project" by University of Penn
      - Considering publication delay perhaps this is the reason?
        - Is archaeology ever current when excavations such as this are done years prior to publications on them? --> how does the world of archaeology stay "up-to-date" with discoveries actively happening, especially smaller/"more boring" projects which wouldn't get much if any news coverage?
    - Topic 45 (data/analysis/number/table) and Topic 55 (data/system/types/information)
      - Topic 45: Gradual rise from around 1960 --> sudden sharp drop at ~1977 --> back to gradual rise --> another random drop more recently --> back to gradual rise
        - Earlier stuff seems to be statistical techniques and chemistry, so manual analysis
        - Unsure of WHY a drop in the 60s, but there's a number of articles on pottery, so perhaps pottery was just an unpopular topic at the time?
        - The highest peak in the late 70s is interesting
          - Articles critiquing methodolgy --> like we do in class
          - Some replies to earlier works
        - Time following this seems to follow trend of developing new methods or tools to use in analyzing archaeological findings and then later questioning ethics of said technology's use as it is applied to archaeological research
    - Topic 55: Similar in the sense that articles turn to the application of technology rather than the ethics which are discussed later
      - Interesting to see a dip during the Web 1.0 era
      - Somewhat of a focus on visualization

  - A Topic Model of World Archaeology
    - From first glance, this all seems very "academically" oriented
      - A lot of the last TM featured discussion of field work and techniques --> this seems to be separated into more neatly defined topics of study
      - Topic 28 has interesting evolution --> earlier 20th century deals with how archaelogy is actually done, but in the 21st century the contents of this topic deal more with cultural consideration and reparations
      - Topic 5 is many of the concepts we deal with in class
        - Makes up a surprising amount of the corpus considering these topics seem to have only begun being accounted for starting in 1993
        - What occured that suddenly made archaeologists think, "wow actually this is important and must be discussed"?
      - More theoretical, less technical
      - Topic 26 --> 2002 has massive spike with a leading paper that discusses collaborative and commuity archaeology
        - Later elements of this topic become more concerned with heritage sites and their preservation
      - I would love to see this after 2020 publications come out --> what topics would be affected by the pandemic? what methodologies?


- Quotes
  - "This lack of diversity hints that there are barriers to study and work for some people but not for others". -White&￼Draycott
  - "Who archaeologists are—our backgrounds, experiences, and mental models—can shape which questions we ask and how we interpret archaeological evidence." -White&￼Draycott
  - "A dispute emerged when members of the community realized that one of the priorities of the archaeology team, which contained no Black members, was to use the remains in efforts to identify different skeletal traits of different races—an aspect of bioarchaeology with roots in now largely discredited race pseudoscience." -White&￼Draycott
  - "Debates   about   the   philosophical or   cultural   dimensions   of   digital   technologies   in the  discipline  have  a  deep  legacy,  yet  the  technical capacities of these tools still tend to eclipse meaningful critique  of  their  implications." -Perry&Taylor
  - "However, that some of these so-called ‘new’ technologies are actually fairly mature suggests that time passed may not make much difference to the development of a critically self-aware approach   in   their   deployment.   Crafting   a   broader critical  framework  in  which  these  methods  can  be embedded as they are adopted  may  be  better  means  to circumvent the effects of the hype cycle." -Perry&Taylor
  - "‘one  of  the  first  tasks  of  a  truly  ‘reflexive archaeology’  is  to  investigate  the  ways  in  which  the discipline  is  complicit  in  legitimizing  structures  of stark inequality.’" -Perry&Taylor
  - Perry&Taylor article brings up point I've been thinking about --> digital archaeology just seems like the future of archaeology as a discipline despite currently being considered separate
    - What archaeologist in 2020 DOESN'T emply any digital methods?
  - "Because these accounts refer to place names and because influential scholars believe that there has been little or no change in tradition, the texts are thought to be an accurate and static record of historical territories...These methods are used to strengthen claims made by Hindus over lands they are occupying." -Gupta
  - "This approach enables a workflow where interpretive decisions can be delayed to a later phase of the project because the material uncovered by the excavation and the record produced by the individual excavator is seen as impartial and atheoretical." -Wilkins
